# u3s - uCore-based K3s deployment

This repository is built upong [uCore](https://github.com/ublue-os/ucore), with the aim to run k3s on-top of an immutable OS using [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc).

It is currently a work-in-progress!

The aim is to closely follow the [uCore](https://github.com/ublue-os/ucore) builds, by using it as a base, only adding on that which is required to easily run and maintain a k3s installation. Updates _should_ be as simple as rebasing to a newer version of the [u3s](https://github.com/kirikae/u3s) image.
